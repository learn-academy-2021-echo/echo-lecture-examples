# React Functional Props 1/3/2022


### Intro to React
- No node modules? yarn
- Component file - App.js
- <> </> - React Fragments
- Inside fragments - JSX
- JSX vs HTML - camelCase attributes, write JS in {}, {{}} styling
- UI, text on the screen

### React State
- Specialized object, hold data
- `super` calls the parent method
- `this` refers to the object/class
- State holds key value pairs
- Keys are symbols
- Data in state creates more dynamic code

### React Props
- Props - properties
- Used to create more dynamic code
- Specialized object
- Pass data into the component call
- Referenced as `this.props`

### Functional Props
- Why? Send info back up the props pipeline
- Functional? Use a function to pass info from the invocation to the logic of the function
- IIF (immediately invoked function) - () after the function call
- Prevent? Wrap in an anonymous function
